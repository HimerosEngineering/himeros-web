===========

Web layer of the Himeros Platform

HimerosWeb is being created in Elixir with the Phoenix Framework.  Why?

  * Very Rails-like: convention over configuration with similar opinions.
  * Elixir syntax is similar to Ruby: lets attract Rails hackers looking for build Erlang/OTP applications.
  * BEAM/Erlang VM: rock-solid with battle-hardened supervisor and concurrency patterns.
  * Erlang/OTP: use the OTP collection of librares to build fault-tolerant soft real-time applications.
  * PostgreSQL: an industry standard RDBMS with excellent support across IaaS and PaaS providers.
